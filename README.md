# Kickstarter-Report

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

- Create stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table you have created.
- Pivot table that will analyze initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per 'sub-category'.
- Create a stacked column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent-category based on the table created.
- Convert Unit timestamps to Excel's date format.
- Pivot table to analyze count of 'state' by date (Month and Year) . Create line graph to visualize the data.
- Count Ifs formula to count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed above. Populate the 'Number Successful', 'Number Failed', and 'Number Canceled' columns with this data.
